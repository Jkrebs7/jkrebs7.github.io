With this I can go into interviews more prepared and show to the potential employer that I am a <b>potential asset</b>.</td>
          <td>My biggest obstacle is staying <b>motivated and optimistic</b> for my own success and future. I need to be able to show myself and future employers that I am a potential employee worth having. My biggest focus for now is to <b>graduate and show I can work for my future</b>.</td>
