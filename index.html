    <h2>Whats this page for?</h2>
    <p>This page is meant to be guide of sorts for myself when thinking about my personal future and continued plans here at KSU. I wanted something tangeble that I could look back on after the semseter is over to guide myself where I'm heading in the future hopefully. So in short this is a <u><b>Guide</b></u> for myself. </p>

  <h2>What's to be expected</h2>
  <hr></hr>
  <p>The page will consist of (currently) a development plan and a about me page. I wanted the home page to be simpler than the others due to it just simply explaining the purpose of the site as a whole. As you can see by the soon tabs nmot currently functional I do plan on adding more pages as the semeseter continues and most likely will also be adding more styling to the site as time goes on.</p>
