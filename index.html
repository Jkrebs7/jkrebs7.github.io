    <h2>Whats this page for?</h2>
    <p>This page is meant to be guide of sorts for myself when thinking about my personal future and continued plans here at KSU. I wanted something tangeble that I could look back on after the semseter is over to guide myself where I'm heading in the future hopefully. So in short this is a <u><b>Guide</b></u> for myself. </p>

  <h2>What's to be expected</h2>
  <hr></hr>
  <p>The page will consist of (currently) a development plan and a about me page. I wanted the home page to be simpler than the others due to it just simply explaining the purpose of the site as a whole. As you can see by the soon tabs nmot currently functional I do plan on adding more pages as the semeseter continues and most likely will also be adding more styling to the site as time goes on.</p>
  <h2>Work in progress</h2>
    <hr></hr>
    <p>I am still working on the home screen as I have not decided what I want its function to be just yet. Some of the other pages are far closer to being complete in a sense than this one. I of course still have plans to update it in the future and add more things to it.</p>
    <h2>My plans going forward</h2>

        <td>
          <ul>    
            <li>Improve the styling, its basic and needs more color and life to it</li>
            <li>Change the nav bar slightly, maybe add more color there as well or animations</li>
            <li>I need to fix the styling errors on cetain pages like the development page and resume page. (The grey area needs to shift to the left like the about me page</li>  
            <li>I want to spice up the about me page more at some point, its supposed to represnt me after all</li>
            <li>I want to add another page at some point ( the "soon" tab on the nav bar)</li>
            <li>I need to do more overviewing of the class material since I am rusty at HTML especially so I can more effiecintly make the site</li>

            <li>I have fixed some of the syting issues but have more changes I'd sstill like to adress later</li>
            <li>I would like to spice up the contact page if possible but that still TBD</li>
            <li>The job page has come out nicely I'd say but could use more still in terms of style</li>
            <li><b>The Home/Index page still needs to be completed fully but I have some ideas on what I want it to be (Think <u>"Update Pgae"</u> for the website)</b></li>
