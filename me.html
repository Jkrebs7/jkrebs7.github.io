      <h2>Who am I?</h2>

      <img src="Me.jpeg" alt="A picture of me" width="250" height="400"/>
      <p>I am a junior at currently enrolled at KSU and am pursuing a degree in IT (With a cybersecurity degree). My ultimate goal just like anyone else is to graduate strongly and obtain a respectable career within the field. I am hoping to graduate with a decently high GPA (currently 3.7) to somewhat prove to myself that I can do it. I have always been passionate about technology ever since I was a kid so it was sort of a no brainer I'd end up pursuing a degree within the tech field. I also plan on updating this page with new goals and other aspects currently going on with my life in terms of my educational and professional goals.</p>

      <h2>Why I Chose This Idea For My Page</h2
      <hr></hr>
      <p>I mainly chose this idea, like mention briefly on the home page, because I wanted a guide for myself to look back on. This could be helpful for me to keep up with important details on my ongoing education and my eventual career path. I could of course just type everything here into a word docurment, but I thought to myself why not just use it for my project? That way im ensuring I can type out anything helpful to my future and also use it to learn for our class.</p>
