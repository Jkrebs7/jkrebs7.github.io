      <p>The purpose of this jobs page is to help me research potential careers that are close to my current educational pursuits.

      <h3>Computer/PC Technician</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>This job is probably on the lower end for income but this is mainly due to experince required and the more entry level nature of the position. I tried to focus on careers that were more <b>Beginner</b> focused.</li>

      <h3>Cyber System Security Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>I once again targeted this career in particular due to it <b>"beginner"</b> nature as it is labeled as an early career.</li>
          <li>Unfortunately the page did not contain a estimate on salary so I'll just guess given other careers I've looked at. Im assuming given it's entry level, that the salary is somewhere between <b>$70,000 - 110,000</b>. It could heavily depend on the fact that its <b>"Entry Level"</b>.</li>
          <li>Just like some of the prvious entries this career expects you to especially be able to work in team enviroments. You wiull be expected to be able to work <b>collaborativley with others</b> to finish your work goals.</li>
          <li>Unlike the other two careers I have looked at so far this one actually calls for a certification in <b>DoD Directive 8570.1 IAT Level II or higher</b>. This is a desired skill to have if applying to this positions specifically.</li>
          <li>The most basic qualification for this career in relation to education is a degree in: <b>B.S. Degree in Cybersecurity, Computer Science, Computer Security, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Information Technology, or Electrical Engineering</b></li>
          <li>This job is especially interesting because it states their is <b>government clearance</b> involved which I found fascinating. It also implies that you shopuld be able to <b>work remotley as well as in office</b>.</li>
        </ul>
